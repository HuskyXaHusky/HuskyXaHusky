- 👋 Hi, I’m Vladimir Shapovalov. By day, I am a simple, even a very simple doctor. However, as the darkness deepens, I become an amateur programmer, coding on the wings of the night.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Everything, I'm interested in everything. In medicine - the abyss of information. It's great that programmers have something to read as well!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning swift, JS (and everything connected with it).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anyone who will make me better.
- 📫 How to reach me ... here
